# Single-Port RAM (Random Access Memory)
A single-port RAM refers to a memory module where both read and write operations can be performed, but not simultaneously. It has only one port for accessing memory, which means the same port is used for both reading from and writing to the memory. The memory can either be in a read or write state at any given time, but not both.
